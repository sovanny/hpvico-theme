For future developers, build js files:

1. install packages with `npm install`
2. run gulp with `npm run build`
3. bundled file main.js is outputted in the dist folder

Gulp is a task runner. In this case it's running webpack and babel. Webpack bundles files. Babel is a compiler that enables us to take the advantages of ES6 and have it brought down to todayâ€™s support for all browsers.
